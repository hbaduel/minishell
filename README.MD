##The Project üíª

Minishell is a 2-person project in C coded as part of my schooling at 42 Perpignan.
It consists of reproducing a shell (bash) including parsing, redirections, signals, environment variables, pipes, some built-ins (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env and exit), etc.
For more details, I invite you to read the topic provided in the repo.

##My mate ü§úü§õ

Like I said, this is a 2 person project. I did it with Alan Andrieux (AlanADX-dev on github/aandrieu on 42Intra).
He took care of the parsing, including redirects, quote management and command line splitting, while I wrote the part on pipes, built-ins, signals, environment variables and heredoc.

##Bonus Part ‚≠ê

We didn't want to do bonuses but there is a hidden one that we coded without knowing that it was a bonus: the management of double quotes in single quotes (or the opposite).
However, this bonus only provides one point.
